        <b>Introduction</b><br>
          Hello! Welcome to my Dungeons and Dragons fan page! Here I will talk about my own personal campaign setting, the country of Misra on the mystical planet Lavosia, as well as my two favorite classes to play in Fifth Edition – Warlock and Cleric. <br>
          <b>Differences in D&D Lore</b><br>
          My campaign follows the Forgotten Realms pantheon and multiverse with one exception: I have my own prime material plane (the world the campaign takes place on). All the gods and separate planes of existence as they are in original Forgotten Realms lore are there, but the history of the main material plane is my own. <br>
          <b>Nation of Misra</b><br>
          My current campaign focuses on the country of Misra, a nation that has been occupied by their northern neighbor, the war-like nation, the Tenoch Empire. For the past 10 years, the country has suffered under the rule of both their Tenochi masters and the iron-grip of Viceroy Walhark. <br>
          <b>Player’s Role</b><br>
          My players will take the role of adventurers who were wrongfully imprisoned, and after being sprung from jail, join the Lionsbrigade – a guerilla resistance movement that aims to liberate their home nation and reseat the princess on the throne. <br>
          <b>Basic Synopsis</b><br>
          Over the course of the campaign, my players will work to liberate those enslaved by Walhark’s work camps and the Tenochi slave trade, discover the true history of the war that ended 10 years ago, and face off against all kinds of supernatural threats. As they work towards freeing their home, they will slowly uncover the secrets of two different ancient civilizations: The Obshar, a nation that excelled in the occult that was destroyed 800 years prior, and the Phram, a civilization from 15,000 years ago that was so advanced technologically that they utilized robotics, teleportation, and energy weapons such as lasers and plasma beams. Over time, my players will recognize the connection between these two civilizations and the current state of the world. <br>

      <h3>Warlock</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Overview</b><br>
        Warlock is a unique spellcasting class that derives its power from occult pacts. Warlocks form contracts with extraplanar entities such as fey, fiends, celestial beings, and creatures from the furthest reaches of the multiverse. These patron beings imbue the warlock with a shard of their power, but often expect them to perform favors and tasks in return.<br>

        <b>Pacts</b><br>
        Warlocks have Pact Magic, which provides spells in a way completely seperate from other spellcasting classes: They have a limited number of spell slots (usually only about 2) and only have slots of their highest available level. To make up for this, Warlocks get their spells back after only a short rest (one hour of resting / light activity). This means that while they can only cast a small amount of spells each encounter, they can easily replenish their spellcasting after each encounter, being at maximum strength when they need it the most.<br>

        <b>Spells</b><br>
        Warlocks have a unique spell list, mostly focusing on dark magic that debilitates and harms their enemies. Eldritch Blast, the Warlock's staple cantrip, is unique to the class and has the highest damage potential of any cantrip.<br>

        <b>Role</b><br>
        The warlock is a versatile class that can be made to fill most any role in the party, but excels at dealing out loads of damage.

      <h3>Cleric</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Overview</b><br>
        Cleric is the go-to divine caster. As devout worshippers of one of the many gods that fill the pantheon, Clerics receive their power from their faith. They pray to their deity, receiving spells and abilites as according to the tenets and profile of their god or goddess.<br>

        <b>Divine Faith</b><br>
        Clerics pray at the start of every day, choosing their memorized spells from their list. They also have domain spells that pertain to the domain of their deity, which they always have memorized. While clerics always have access to the entire spell list for their class, they can only memorize a limited number of spells each day from that list.<br>

        <b>Spells</b><br>
        Clerics have the most "buff" spells of any class, which give a myriad of beneficial and empowering effects for their allies. They also have access to every healing spell, as well as some damaging and debilitating spells.<br>

        <b>Role</b><br>
        While clerics can be made to fill most any role, they are by far the most powerful and efficient healers. But with the different domains, a cleric can easily be a frontline fighter, a backline archer, or even one that flings fireballs or curses enemies.<br>
