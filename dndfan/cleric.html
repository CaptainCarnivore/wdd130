            <section class="left-box-content">Cleric is the go-to divine caster. As devout worshippers of one of the many gods that fill the pantheon, Clerics receive their power from their faith. They pray to their deity, receiving spells and abilites as according to the tenets and profile of their god or goddess.</section>

            <section class="box-content">Clerics pray at the start of every day, choosing their memorized spells from their list. They also have domain spells that pertain to the domain of their deity, which they always have memorized. While clerics always have access to the entire spell list for their class, they can only memorize a limited number of spells each day from that list.</section>

            <section class="box-content">While clerics can be made to fill most any role, they are by far the most powerful and efficient healers. But with the different domains, a cleric can easily be a frontline fighter, a backline archer, or even one that flings fireballs or curses enemies.</section>
