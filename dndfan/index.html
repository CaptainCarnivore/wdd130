As they work towards freeing their home, they will slowly uncover the secrets of two different ancient civilizations: The Obshar, a nation that excelled in the occult that was destroyed 800 years prior, and the Phram, a civilization from 15,000 years ago that was so advanced technologically that they utilized robotics, teleportation, and energy weapons such as lasers and plasma beams. Over time, my players will recognize the connection between these two civilizations and the current state of the world.<br><br> </section>
