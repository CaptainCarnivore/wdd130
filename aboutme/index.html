    <h2>Austin Tyler Jensen</h2>
    <p>Howdy! I'm a 27-year-old desert rat from Tucson, Arizona. I am pursuing my Associate's in Computer Programming. 
        I've lived in this dusty town my whole life.</p>
    <p>I recently had bariatric surgery (last April) and since the start of 2021 I've lost over 110 pounds. I'm healthier
        than I've been in years, and I'm looking to take more control of my life.
    </p>
    <p>I am an avid gamer, and my main passion right now is playing Tabletop Roleplaying Games, 
        such as Dungeons & Dragons. As an amatuer author, I've been spending most of my creative juices 
        on building and expanding on the world I've created for my players to experience and explore.
    </p>
    <p>I'm looking forward to working with you all. This is far from my first Programming course, 
        I just need to take this one as a 
     pre-req for another class needed for my degree.</p>
